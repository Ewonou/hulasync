Offline Syncing for ClientSide Web Applications

Steps to run:

* npm install
* npm install -g grunt-cli
* grunt
* node server.js

Commits to master:

* shouldn't break the build (which is pretty easy since there are no unit tests)
* should "look right" and "work" (don't worry, we'll get to unit tests)

Otherwise create a branch and hack away!
